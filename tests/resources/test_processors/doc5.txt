This doc also tests a replacements with custom tokens, so I need to write some of them:
- For example a date: early 90s or sixteenth of january 2020
- Another example will be text (in brackets)

And list with only one item:
- my item

Here is a random looooong list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
- item 4
- item 5

And last one list with only tokens to replace:
- 12
- 43
-5
> 23
>333334
