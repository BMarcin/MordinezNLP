Here we can teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest how function will leave multiple characters in a word. And also we can add some cool links: <url>. This doc also tests a replacements with custom tokens, so I need to write some of them: For example a date: <hereisdate> or <hereisdate>, Another example will be text <hereisbracket> in brackets <hereisbracket>. And list with only <number> item: my item. Here is a random looooong list: item <number>, item <number>, item <number>, item <number>, item <number>. And last <number> list with only tokens to replace: <number>.
