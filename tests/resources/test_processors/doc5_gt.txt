Here we can teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest how function will leave multiple characters in a word. And also we can add some cool links: <url>. This doc also tests a replacements with custom tokens, so I need to write some of them: For example a date: <here-is-date> or <here-is-date>, Another example will be text <here-is-bracket> in brackets <here-is-bracket>. And list with only one item: my item. Here is a random looooong list: item <number>, item <number>, item <number>, item <number>, item <number>. And last one list with only tokens to replace: <number>.
