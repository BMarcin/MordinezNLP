So when 'we' care about the universe, the universe is caring about itself. Of course, by the same token, the universe does care about you... assuming you're not toxic and friendless.

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Steve4964   41 points 42 points 43 points   4 years ago   (15 children) I mean atoms aren't elementary particles. They consist of protons, neutrons and electrons. Electrons are leptons and believed to be elementary. But protons and neutrons consist of quarks. Quarks I believe are more or less elementary but I think string theory states that quarks consist of little string things. Idk. String theory is weird, and I'm not a physicist.

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Steve4964   11 points 12 points 13 points   4 years ago   (0 children) Well I gave a very rough explanation. Professors will always dive into detail (because they are experts on the subject) which is why it can be more obscure.  If you're really interested in elementary particles try looking up the Standard Model of particle physics. I study biology, but I don't think there exists anybody in any field who doesn't find particle physics at least somewhat fascinating.

 permalink embed save parent [–] FogOfInformation   12 points 13 points 14 points   4 years ago   (9 children) Why? Because everything we know or imagine has a cause and effect. I too love talking about space.  
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] onemandisco   7 points 8 points 9 points   4 years ago   (5 children) Cause and effect could be another construct and doesn't necessarily have to exist.  
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] FogOfInformation   6 points 7 points 8 points   4 years ago   (4 children) Could . However, the evidence we have now says we are to go with cause and effect. Of course, I'm all for speculating. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] onemandisco   11 points 12 points 13 points   4 years ago   (2 children) Looks like you are! I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you either, but just for the sake of discussion... 

 To answer the question of, "why does it have to start?" you said, "everything we know or imagine has a cause and effect", but that isn't true.  

 Try to imagine time not existing. Without time, there is no reason to believe A effects B any more than B is the cause of A. Neither happened first.  

 So, the universe doesn't necessarily have to have a start. In fact, it's more likely to me that it doesn't have a start, because having a start would imply there was nothing before it started, and nothing, by it's own definition, can't exist. But that only works if you define the universe as everything. THIS universe (if you apply the layer of time) most likely did have a start, but I don't think the cause of this universe's start was nothing, but something else.  

 Here's the problem with these types of discussions, though. Neither of us are educated in how to discuss these things properly, so there are likely to be all kinds of semantical arguments and interpretations to arise out of this, but 'round we go!

So, ok, we learn with 100% irrefutable evidence that God is real, and he created the Big Bang and left the universe alone after that. Ok. Who is God? Where the eff did  he  come from? 

 Then we get an answer to that question. Ok...well where did the thing that created God come from?

 Well good news!  NASA's Europa Mission  is slated for launch in 2022. 

 It's not humans going there of course, but a Jupiter orbiter with lots of close passes by Europa and a wealth of advanced scientific instruments to map and study the planet is far better, at this point, than humans going up there anyway.

 investigate whether the icy moon could harbor conditions suitable for life. 
 

 That's great and all but without a lander to get under the ice, it won't be able to detect life.  Most people reading this will die not knowing whats under that ice. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Frencil   98 points 99 points 100 points   4 years ago   (76 children) Small moves, Ellie. 

 That ice is thick and dynamic. The resolution in OP's image (according to the  catalog page for it ) is 735 feet (224 meters) per pixel and it's among the highest resolution imagery of the surface we've got in the  visible  spectrum. Imagery spanning a much broader spectrum to give us information on surface composition is even more coarse-grain. We're simply not ready to send up a lander, let alone something capable of boring through several miles of ice. 

 That's why this upcoming Europa mission is so important. High resolution mapping across a wide spectral band for the entire moon. Critical prep work for a more successful lander mission. Sure we could also send down a probe before an orbiter gives us a better overview of things (the  Huygens Probe  is a good example of that) but Titan was a bit more of a special case than Europa because it has a far more dynamic surface and a thick atmosphere. Europa's most interesting bits are likely under that thick surface, and we're not getting in there until we've got a better picture of just what it takes to do it. 

 
 Most people reading this will die not knowing whats under that ice. 
 

 There are a great many things the people reading this will die without knowing, but they know so much more than those past just by living through this era of discovery, however much of it.

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] The_quietest_voice   11 points 12 points 13 points   4 years ago   (3 children) At 224m(735 ft) per pixel, that's 50176m 2  per pixel square. The area of the potato shape is about 17000 pixels square, so that means its area is 853 million m 2  or 853 km 2  or 330 mi 2  . To put that into perspective, that's about the size of  the city of San Diego or New York City.

As a student of life, and a lover of knowledge, how could I ever justify what I know as 'enough'?

 The high-resolution images for this view were obtained by the Galileo Solid-State Imaging (SSI) experiment on September 25, 1998. They were then combined with lower-resolution color data from an observation taken on March 29, 1998. The high-resolution images have a pixel scale of 735 feet (224 meters) per pixel, and the image is approximately 220 miles (350 kilometers) wide [tall in this case since this is rotated from the original image].

 permalink embed save give award [–] NurseNasty10   410 points 411 points 412 points   4 years ago   (111 children) The surface is ice over a planet wide ocean. The gravity from Jupiter keeps the interior warm and causes the ice to crack, the ocean water seeps out the cracks and refreezes. Stuff in the water causes the colour differences.  
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] [deleted]   63 points 64 points 65 points   4 years ago   (53 children) also the asteroids that come from time to time must play a part in the color. 
 
 permalink embed save parent [–] pieinabutt   73 points 74 points 75 points   4 years ago   (52 children) The color is caused by the age of the ice, older ice has more small cracks causing it to be whiter, where as new ice let's you see the dark ocean underneath. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Nerd_Bro   104 points 105 points 106 points   4 years ago   (42 children) Actually, the reddish tint likely comes from  salty compounds in the oceans getting exposed to the harsh conditions of the surface.

But if we end up finding life on Mars  AND  Europa and maybe even  Titan  (but probably not), there will be little doubt that most stars similar to ours are host to some form of life.

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Infinitefungi   62 points 63 points 64 points   4 years ago   (34 children) The gravitational pull causes the planet to reshape to a more oblong shape, and then it returns to its original shape at the end of its elliptical orbit so the friction of the constantly changing core of the planet causes it to heat up  
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] commentings   14 points 15 points 16 points   4 years ago   (30 children) Forgive me for going off topic a bit but I'd be interested to know if a moon could orbit a planet like Jupiter and continue to be heated for infinity, and by doing so be an anomaly of the eventual heat death of the universe?  
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] knaving   42 points 43 points 44 points   4 years ago   (3 children) That would assume that the planet causing the gravitational friction sticks around too. Like everything else, both parties would eventually wear away. When it comes to infinity, there are no anomalies. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award load more comments  (3 replies) [–] Franks2000inchTV   26 points 27 points 28 points   4 years ago   (15 children) No, unfortunately not. The friction from the motion of the core resists the motion and gradually slows the orbit. Small debris in the way of the plant will also slow the moon down.  

 Eventually the moon will crash into jupiter. There's no escaping the second law of thermodynamics.

Eventually, the smaller orbiting objects will fall into the larger objects. That is, unless they get smacked/swung out of orbit by something else. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Nerd_Bro   6 points 7 points 8 points   4 years ago   (1 child) No, the planet would eventually lose rotational speed (so it was heated less) and orbital speed (so it would eventually crash into Jupiter).

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Chawp   4 points 5 points 6 points   4 years ago   (0 children) The same way the moon creates ocean tides on earth with gravitational forces. Now replace Earth with an ice crusted ocean world, and the moon with a much more massive Jupiter. Those tidal forces will be quite strong, enough to flex the planet and provide mechanical heating. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] FirstWorldAnarchist   3 points 4 points 5 points   4 years ago   (0 children) It is similar to stretching a rubber band. If you stretch it a few times, it gets hot after a while, while "gravity" (tension) keeps it together.

 permalink embed save give award [–] 0thatguy   13 points 14 points 15 points   4 years ago   (9 children) We are. NASA's building a Europa Mission that will perform repeated flybys of Europa and use radar to judge the thickness of the icy shell and the depth of the ocean. It wont actually go into the ocean, but it will sample plumes of ocean material erupting out of the cracks and see what's in it. It will image the surface of Europa in high detail to find a landing site for a lander that will arrive two years later.

Surface doesn't look so habitable to be honest.. 
 
 permalink embed save give award [–] [deleted]   81 points 82 points 83 points   4 years ago   (13 children) Europa has a liquid water ocean under the ice, due to the heating from Jupiter's gravity. it is possible that life exists there. As far as we know, the conditions there are not far from those in the lakes under the ice in the antarctic, and there is life there.

 permalink embed save parent give award [–] ElephantTeeth   17 points 18 points 19 points   4 years ago   (3 children) There are archaea and bacteria on earth living near hydrothermal vents; unlike most life on Earth, oxygen is not required for these organisms to thrive. Europa's seas (according to certain measurements) are believed to have all necessary elements for these forms of life. 

 Both NASA and the ESA are working on orbiters destined for Jupiter and the Galilean moons; I believe NASA's has a sensor specifically designed to search Europa's ice ejecta for life. 
 
 permalink embed save parent give award [–] Derwos   4 points 5 points 6 points   4 years ago   (2 children) Earth life originated in a much different environment than what we have now. Does/did Europa have the necessary conditions for life to not just survive, but originate?

Europa isn't habitable, not by Earth life. But Europan life?  
 
 permalink embed save parent [–] the_boomr   5 points 6 points 7 points   4 years ago *   (3 children) It always bothers me when I hear scientists (especially in movies) say that life on such and such planet or moon would be "impossible", just because it doesn't match Earth's environment/atmosphere/conditions. Sure, it would be impossible for life as we know it (needing an atmosphere with certain elements, having a brain, respiratory/circulatory systems etc., anything we're familiar with on Earth) to survive, but just because we can't imagine another way for life to exist doesn't mean it couldn't happen. There could be some alien race somewhere in the universe that survives or even thrives in the vacuum of space! We simply don't know. 

 Now, I do understand that in the search for ET life, it makes the most sense to look for similar conditions to ours, because that's all we know, so our search should be narrowed down to focus on something we'll be able to recognize. But still, I think it's silly when people say/think that it's 100% impossible for life to exist in some completely unknown and different kind of environment. 

 EDIT: Changed my parenthetical to be more broad and accurate-ish.

These ecosystems (including complex life like crabs) are fueled only by volcanism. If there is volcanism in the rocky core of Europa then it could fuel an ecosystem in the ice/water
