        Function allows user to download files from provided URLs in list. Each file is downloaded as BytesIO using
        specified number of threads and then *file_type_handler* is used to convert file from BytesIO to specified
        format. Each file type should have its own *file_type_handler*.

        Sleep_time is used to prevent sites from detecting DDoS attacks. Before downloading file specified thread
        is going to sleep for specified amount of time.

        Function for each thread (and for each single URL) uses *download_to_bytes_io* function.

        disk.
